Data: https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction/data

This is a multi-level classification problem in which data collected about pets (dogs and cats) listed on the website petfinder.com to predict how quickly a newly listed pet will be adopted based on its features, including, but not limited to, size, age, color, and sex. The classification levels are as follows:

0 - Pet was adopted on the same day as it was listed.\n
1 - Pet was adopted between 1 and 7 days (1st week) after being listed.

2 - Pet was adopted between 8 and 30 days (1st month) after being listed.

3 - Pet was adopted between 31 and 90 days (2nd & 3rd month) after being listed.

4 - No adoption after 100 days of being listed. (There are no pets in this dataset that waited between 90 and 100 days). 

We propose using a CNN for this classification prediction but will additionally explore other types of NNs.
