\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The website PetFinder.my, founded in 2008, is Malaysia's leading animal
welfare platform. The data posted on Kaggle for the Adoption Prediction
Competition contains 24 variables, images, and sentiment data.

\hypertarget{data-preparation}{%
\subsection{Data Preparation}\label{data-preparation}}

For this problem, we decided to attempt to predict adoption speed with
only the data provided. The data and data fields included may be viewed
at \url{https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction/data}.
Below are the first 5 observations of the training data provided.

## 1                                   Nibble is a 3+ month old ball of cuteness. He is energetic and playful. I rescued a couple of cats a few months ago but could not get them neutered in time as the clinic was fully scheduled. The result was this little kitty. I do not have enough space and funds to care for more cats in my household. Looking for responsible people to take over Nibble's care.
## 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I just found it alone yesterday near my apartment. It was shaking so I had to bring it home to provide temporary care.
## 3 Their pregnant mother was dumped by her irresponsible owner at the roadside near some shops in Subang Jaya. Gave birth to them at the roadside. They are all healthy and adorable puppies. Already dewormed, vaccinated and ready to go to a home. No tying or caging for long hours as guard dogs. However, it is acceptable to cage or tie for precautionary purposes. Interested to adopt pls call me.
## 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Good guard dog, very alert, active, obedience waiting for her good master, plz call or sms for more details if you really get interested, thanks!!

We first removed the identifier fields RescuerID and PetID. After
manually searching through the Descriptions, we decided that attemting
NLP on the text was out of our scope, and decided to remove it.
